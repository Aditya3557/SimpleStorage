# SimpleStorage

## Project Description
SimpleStorage is a Solidity smart contract that allows storing, retrieving, and resetting a fixed number (42) without requiring any input from the user. It demonstrates basic storage and retrieval of state in a smart contract.

## Project Vision
To provide a beginner-friendly example of how to manipulate contract state variables without external inputs perfect for learning the fundamentals of Solidity.

## Key Features
- Store a predefined number (42) in the contract.
- Retrieve the stored number.
- Reset the stored number to zero.
- No inputs required to call the core functions.

## Future Scope
- Extend the contract to support multiple predefined numbers.
- Add event logging for storage actions.
- Integrate with front-end UI to demonstrate state changes.
- Enable scheduled automatic storage updates via smart contract automation.
